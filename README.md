## Proposed Project:
This dataset contains MRI images from 67 patients diagnosed with aggressive malignant brain tumours. These tumours are categorized into two types: high grade gliomas (HGG) and brain metastases (BM). Our objective is to determine whether these MRI images can be used to train a model that predicts whether a patient has HGG or BM. For each patient, four different MRI modalities are provided: FLAIR, T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images. We aim to investigate how different combinations of these images (e.g., FLAIR alone, FLAIR + T1-weighted, etc.) influence prediction accuracy. If time permits, we also plan to incorporate radiomics features identified in the study into these combinations of input data to assess whether they further improve the performance of the machine learning models.
